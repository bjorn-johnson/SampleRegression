This was a take-home assessment for a data science interview using two non-descript & continuous independant variables to predict a continuous dependant variable. 

Create a folder anywhere in your file explorer (currently named 'BLA' in the markdown script, but feel free to keep or change that) and place both the input .csv file and the markdown script in there in order to run the script.
